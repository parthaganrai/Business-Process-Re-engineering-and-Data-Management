#APPROVING LOAN APPLICATION PROCESS

From an ambitious student aspiring to study in a prestigious university to a farmer hoping to reap good number of crops prefer to avail a loan from a bank. Banks scrutinize each loan application meticulously to reduce the risk of lending a loan to an individual who cannot pay back. The major setback in the AS-IS process is multiple hand-offs of documents and manual processes, which ultimately adds up to the loan processing time.

The proposed TO-BE process contains a central database system with bankers, customers and the consultant agents to be its major stake holders. Introduction of relational database in the process elminates the delay caused by multiple handoffs and increases transperancy between process. An advanced notification and tracking system will drastically improve the loan processing and increased customer satisfaction.
